This is a Zig project to work with hex timestamps.
I'm doing it mostly to learn Zig, which suits it fairly well.

Here's the site for Zig: https://ziglang.org/

Here's my old repository for shell scripts that work
with the same timestamps:

https://bitbucket.org/x31eq/binaryclock

You might also find a Rust repository that I've been
working on in parallel.

My current opinion of Zig is that it's quite a good
replacement for C but the implementation could do with more polish
and the standard library could do with documentation.
Maybe you found this after searching for help on formatting
with the standard library, in which case, yes, you'll learn
something about hex formatting here.
I worked it out mostly from the source code.

I call out to a standard C library to get the local time.
(I don't know how standard it is -- at least it works in Linux.)
This is a good example of how simple it is to work with
C libraries in Zig.

It isn't finished yet.  We'll see how long it interests me
and whether I remember to update this file.

I used a makefile because although Zig has its own system
that apparently makes them redundant, I don't know how to use it.
I also hard-coded the path I happened to extract the binary to.
You'll probably want to change this.
